# merzmail
Scrape and analyse the [#merzmail](https://www.friedrich-merz.de/merzmail/merzmail-152/) newsletters by CDU leader Friedrich Merz as 
well as the far-right AfD's press releases using {rvest} and {RSelenium}. 

Plans for the future

* Calculate document similarity / distinctiveness by source over time
* keyness anaylsis (maybe also over time for specific words like "Woke", or "Cancel Culture" or other far-right buzzwords.

Feel free to fork the repo/fetch the data and use it for you own analyses.
