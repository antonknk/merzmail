# merzmail
Initially, this project was set up to scrape and analyse the [#merzmail](https://www.friedrich-merz.de/merzmail/merzmail-152/) newsletters by CDU leader Friedrich Merz. It has meanwhile been extended to all press releases of parties in the German Bundestag.

The project draws on {rvest} and {RSelenium}. 

Feel free to fork the repo/fetch the data and use it for you own analyses.
